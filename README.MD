A learning project exploring Nix and its capabilities for development environments and reproducible builds.

## What I've Learned

- Using Nix flakes for project configuration


## Getting Started

1. Enter the Nix development environment:
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd src
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
